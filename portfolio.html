        <h3>Why Programming</h3>
        <p>I have always been interested in computers since I was really young and always liked building things. Sadly I was not able<br> to get access to a computer until after High School, I got interest in the computer world and always wonder how the programs <br>in them worked then I got interest in how the mobile apps worked and how they are made that directed me to programming, <br>so I began looking out in google what really programming is and how programs work, that is when my journey began, though <br>it has taken few years but now my dream has become true.</p>
